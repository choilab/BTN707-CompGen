### Objective
The goal of this analysis was to identify **surface proteins (surfaceome)**  
from the complete genome of *Staphylococcus epidermidis*.  

Two main strategies were applied:  
1. **Annotation-based approach**  
   - Genes with keywords such as `"surface"`, `"wall"`, `"lipoprotein"` were selected.  
2. **Sequence-based approach**  
   - Prediction of signal peptides, sortase motifs, and subcellular localization using deep learning.
---

### Methods

**Test Genome:** *S. epidermidis* ATCC14990 (preliminary test before applying to all genomes) - Number of genes: 2,368

1. **Annotation-based keyword search**  
   - Keywords: `"surface"`, `"wall"`, `"lipoprotein"`

2. **Sequence-based prediction tools**  
   - **SignalP:** Predicts signal peptides and secretion pathway (exact position not predicted)  
   - **GPApred:** Predicts genes containing sortase motifs  
   - **DeepLocPro:** Deep learning-based prediction of subcellular localization

### Results

#### 1. Annotation-based keyword search
| Keyword | Number of genes |
|---------|----------------:|
| Total identified | 43 |
| Lipoprotein | 21 |
| Surface | 5 |
| Wall | 20 |

#### 2. Sequence-based prediction
| Tool | Prediction type | Number of predicted genes |
|------|----------------|--------------------------:|
| GPApred | Sortase motif | 193 |
| SignalP | Signal peptide | 785 |
| DeepLocPro | Surface, Wall, Extracellular | 130 |

### To do next
- These predictions can later be compared with experimental data (e.g., mass spectrometry) to validate surfaceome composition.
- Same strategies will be applied to all public _Staphylococcus_ genes to make pan-genomic surfaceom.

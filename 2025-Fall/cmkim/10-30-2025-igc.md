## Discussion
1. use more programs - TMHMM, Phobius...
   1) make a big profiles of genes...
3. collect probe genes (known feature surface proteins) - Aap, Sdrd...
4. after prediction, categorize surface proteins by patterns/structures (e.g. Alphafold)
5. can we predict protein-protein interaction of surface proteins?

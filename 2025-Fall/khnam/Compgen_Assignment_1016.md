## Q1. How many genomes have been published for *Staphylococcus epidermidis*?

Based on NCBI data, approximately 5038 annotated genomes of *S.epidermidis* are available at complete genome level
Selecting the lower assembly level (e.g. chromosome, scaffold), the number of genomes available decreases

## Q2. Then, how can they be downloaded?

1. Connect to [NCBI Assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/)
2. Search *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
3. Set filter : Assembly level = Complete genome
4. Choose the strain you want
5. Download genome -> format: .fna (genome sequence), .gff (annotation features) 

The 100 Refseq genomes of *S.epidermidis* are downloaded
